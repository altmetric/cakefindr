# Cakefindr

Cakefindr is a distributed application that implements discovery and retrieval of delicious cake-based rewards.

Today we're going to deploy Cakefindr by working through the process of building an application hosting cluster using the Hashicorp framework. This is like a minature version of the cluster we're currently building to host Altmetric's applications in the future.

After this exercise, it'll hopfully be a little bit clearer how the Hashicorp framework fits together, and how you can write job specifications and build Docker images in order to deploy applications to it.

Worth through the stages below in your teams, and if you have any questions Alex and Matt will be able to help!
